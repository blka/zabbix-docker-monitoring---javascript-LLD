# zabbix-docker-monitoring---javascript-LLD


 Updated now  zabbix template for docker /docker swarm monitoring (linux but windows should work too?), based only on javascript LLD, no file configuration is needed. 
 just pin template do host..  
 
 ofc. make sure (on monitored host) zabbix user is in docker group
 
 gpasswd -a zabbix docker
